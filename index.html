Candid wedding photographers in Kolkata has become more preferable than posed photography because of the rigidness associated with the latter. The formula is simple; posing for a photograph makes the subject conscious, this leading to very unimpressive photographs. With candid photography, however, because the subject usually does not know that he or she is being photographed, the realness becomes very apparent</p>
